# I just get stuck on it. T____T Difficult to solve that in one day. I even can not understand the example. So upset about that.
# It seems that in the video the professor teaches me "1+1=2" and then the assignment shows "if y=ln(-6x^2+7x+3), what is y'?"
# Whatever, I will try to solve it next week. Hope everything goes well. T________T
# BTW: would you mind providing your code for me? (Just paste your link in the "feedback") 
# I just wanna know whether my code is right in the future. Thank you so much for you nice help~:)
